    // 1. The Cat

    // Write yourself a virtual cat - animals with a CLI are so much nicer than ones with fur.

    // Create an object that represents a cat. It should have properties for tiredness, hunger, lonliness and happiness
    // Next, write methods that increase and decrease those properties. Call them something that actually represents what would increase or decrease these things, like "feed", "sleep", or "pet".
    // Last, write a method that prints out the cat's status in each area. (Be creative e.g. Paws is really hungry, Paws is VERY happy.)
    // Bonus: Make the functions take arguments that increase or decrease arbitrary amounts
    // Bonus: Make the functions as arbitrary as cats are - sometimes make it so the cat doesn't want to be petted.

    // class VCat {
    //   constructor() {
    //     this.hunger = 0;
    //     this.tiredness = 0;
    //     this.lonliness = 0;
    //     this.happiness = 0;
    //   }

    //   feed() {
    //     this.hunger = this.hunger - 10;
    //   }

    //   play() {
    //     this.lonliness = this.lonliness;
    //   }
    // }

    // 2. The Reading List

    // Create a class BookList

    class Booklist {
      constructor(currentBook = {}, nextBook = {}) {
        this.nextBook = nextBook;
        this.currentBook = currentBook;
        this.lastBook = {};
        this.list = [];
      }
      addBook(book) {
        this.list = this.list.concat(book);
      }

      completedCurrentBook() {
        this.lastBook = this.currentBook;
        this.currentBook = this.nextBook;
        this.nextBook = {};
      }
    }

    class Book {
      constructor(title, author, genre) {
        this.title = title;
        this.genre = genre;
        this.author = author;
        this.read = false;
        this.readDate = '';
      }

      readBook() {
        this.read = true;
        this.readDate = new Date();
      }

    }

    const handmaidsTale = new Book('handmaids tail', 'marget atwood', 'sci-fi');
    const harryPotter = new Book('harry potter', 'jk rowling', 'fantasy');

    const bookList = new BookList(handmaidsTale, harryPotter);
    bookList.completedCurrentBook();
    console.log(bookList);
    // Create another class called Book
    // BookLists should have the following properties:
    //     A reference to the next book to read (book object)
    //     A reference to the current book being read (book object)
    //     A reference to the last book read (book object)
    //     An array of all the Books



    // Each Book should have several properties:
    //     Title
    //     Genre
    //     Author
    //     Read (true or false)
    //     Read date, can be blank, otherwise needs to be a JS Date() object

    // Every Booklist should have a few methods:
    //     .add(book)
    //         should add a book to the books list.
    //     .booksRead()
    //        should return an array of read books
    //     .booksUnread()
    //        should return an array of unread books
    //     .currentBook(book)
    //        should set a book as the current book
    //     .nextBook(book)
    //         should set the next book to be read
    //     .finishCurrentBook()
    //         should mark the book that is currently being read as "read"
    //         Give it a read date of new Date(Date.now())
    //         Change the last book read to be the book that just got finished
    //         Change the current book to be the next book to be read
    //         Change the next book to be read property to be the first unread book you find in the list of books
    // Booklists and Books might need more methods than that. Try to think of more that might be useful.
