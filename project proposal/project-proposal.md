Fullstack Project Proposal

Name: Whitney Reid
Email: whitney.reid.codes@gmail.com
Description: A book app which lets a user add a book to their bookshelf and keep a rating and notes about their book.

MVC:
- a user can sign in with their email and password
- a user can add a book to their bookshelf
- a user can see all the book in their bookshelf
- a user can add notes to their books
Stretch:
- make use of the goodreads API to get book data (requires investigation)
- create a 'friends list' of other users in the app
- enable certain friends to see your private notes about a book you've read
